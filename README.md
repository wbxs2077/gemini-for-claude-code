## Prerequisites

- A Google Gemini API key.
- Python 3.8+.
- Claude Code CLI installed (e.g., `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`).

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coffeegrind123/gemini-code.git # Or your fork
    cd gemini-code
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit `.env` and add your Gemini API key. You can also customize model mappings and server settings:
    ```dotenv
    # Required: Your Google AI Studio API key. You can provide multiple keys separated by commas for key rotation.
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your-google-ai-studio-key-1,your-google-ai-studio-key-2"

    # Optional: Model mappings for Claude Code aliases
    BIG_MODEL="gemini-1.5-pro-latest"    # For 'sonnet' or 'opus' requests
    SMALL_MODEL="gemini-1.5-flash-latest" # For 'haiku' requests
    
    # Optional: Server settings
    HOST="0.0.0.0"
    PORT="8082"
    LOG_LEVEL="WARNING"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
    
    # Optional: Performance and reliability settings
    MAX_TOKENS_LIMIT="8192"           # Max tokens for Gemini responses
    REQUEST_TIMEOUT="90"              # Request timeout in seconds
    MAX_RETRIES="2"                   # LiteLLM retries to Gemini
    MAX_STREAMING_RETRIES="12"         # Streaming-specific retry attempts
    
    # Optional: Streaming control (use if experiencing issues)
    FORCE_DISABLE_STREAMING="false"     # Disable streaming globally
    EMERGENCY_DISABLE_STREAMING="false" # Emergency streaming disable
    ```

5.  **Run the server**:
    The `server.py` script includes a `main()` function that starts the Uvicorn server:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
    For development with auto-reload (restarts when you save changes to `server.py`):
    ```bash
    uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8082 --reload
    ```
    You can view all startup options, including configurable environment variables, by running:
    ```bash
    python server.py --help
    ```

## Usage with Claude Code

1.  **Start the Proxy Server**: Ensure the Gemini proxy server (this application) is running (see step 5 above).

2.  **Configure Claude Code to Use the Proxy**:
    Set the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` environment variable when running Claude Code:
    ```bash
    ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8082 claude
    ```
    Replace `localhost:8082` if your proxy is running on a different host or port.

3.  **Utilize `CLAUDE.md` for Optimal Gemini Performance (Crucial)**:
    - This repository includes a `CLAUDE.md` file. This file contains specific instructions and best practices tailored to help **Gemini** effectively understand and respond to **Claude Code's** unique command structure, tool usage patterns, and desired output formats.
    - **Copy `CLAUDE.md` into your project directory**:
      ```bash
      cp /path/to/gemini-code/CLAUDE.md /your/project/directory/
      ```
    - When starting a new conversation with Claude Code in that directory, begin with:
      ```
      First read and process CLAUDE.md with intent. After understanding and agreeing to use the policies and practices outlined in the document, respond with YES
      ```
    - This ensures Gemini receives important context and instructions for better assistance.
  
    - If Gemini still fucks up, ask it to read CLAUDE.md again. This might or might not help!

## How It Works: Powering Claude Code with Gemini

1.  **Claude Code Request**: You issue a command or prompt in the Claude Code CLI.
2.  **Anthropic Format**: Claude Code sends an API request (in Anthropic's Messages API format) to the proxy server's address (`http://localhost:8082`).
3.  **Proxy Translation (Anthropic to Gemini)**: The proxy server:
    *   Receives the Anthropic-formatted request.
    *   Validates it and maps any Claude model aliases (like `claude-3-sonnet...`) to the corresponding Gemini model specified in your `.env` (e.g., `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`).
    *   Translates the message structure, content blocks, and tool definitions into a format LiteLLM can use with the Gemini API.
4.  **LiteLLM to Gemini**: LiteLLM sends the prepared request to the target Gemini model using your `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
5.  **Gemini Response**: Gemini processes the request and sends its response back through LiteLLM.
6.  **Proxy Translation (Gemini to Anthropic)**: The proxy server:
    *   Receives the Gemini response from LiteLLM (this can be a stream of events or a complete JSON object).
    *   Handles streaming errors and malformed chunks with intelligent recovery.
    *   Converts Gemini's output (text, tool calls, stop reasons) back into the Anthropic Messages API format that Claude Code expects.
7.  **Response to Claude Code**: The proxy sends the Anthropic-formatted response back to your Claude Code client, which then displays the result or performs the requested action.

## Model Mapping for Claude Code

To ensure Claude Code's model requests are handled correctly by Gemini:

- Requests from Claude Code for model names containing **"haiku"** (e.g., `claude-3-haiku-20240307`) are mapped to the Gemini model specified by your `SMALL_MODEL` environment variable (default: `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`).
- Requests from Claude Code for model names containing **"sonnet"** or **"opus"** (e.g., `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`) are mapped to the Gemini model specified by your `BIG_MODEL` environment variable (default: `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`).
- If Claude Code requests a full Gemini model name (e.g., `gemini/gemini-1.5-pro-latest`), the proxy will use that directly.

The server maintains a list of known Gemini models. If a recognized Gemini model is requested by the client without the `gemini/` prefix, the proxy will add it.

## Endpoints

- `POST /v1/messages`: The primary endpoint for Claude Code to send messages to Gemini. It's fully compatible with the Anthropic Messages API specification that Claude Code uses.
- `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens`: Allows Claude Code to estimate the token count for a set of messages, using Gemini's tokenization.
- `GET /health`: Returns the health status of the proxy, including API key configuration, streaming settings, and basic API key validation.
- `GET /test-connection`: Performs a quick API call to Gemini to verify connectivity and that your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is working.
- `GET /`: Root endpoint providing a welcome message, current configuration summary (models, limits), and available endpoints.

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Streaming Errors (malformed chunks):**
- The proxy automatically handles malformed JSON chunks from Gemini
- If streaming becomes unstable, set `FORCE_DISABLE_STREAMING=true` as a temporary fix
- Increase `MAX_STREAMING_RETRIES` for more resilient streaming

**Gemini 500 Internal Server Errors:**
- The proxy automatically retries with exponential backoff
- These are temporary Gemini API issues that resolve automatically
- Check `/health` endpoint to monitor API status

**Connection Timeouts:**
- Increase `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` if experiencing frequent timeouts
- Check your internet connection and firewall settings
- Use `/test-connection` endpoint to verify API connectivity

**Rate Limiting:**
- Monitor your Google AI Studio quota in the Google Cloud Console
- The proxy will provide specific rate limit guidance in error messages

### Emergency Mode

If you experience persistent issues:
```bash
# Disable streaming temporarily
export EMERGENCY_DISABLE_STREAMING=true

# Or force disable all streaming
export FORCE_DISABLE_STREAMING=true
```

## Logging

The server provides detailed logs, which are especially useful for understanding how Claude Code requests are translated for Gemini and for monitoring error recovery. Logs are colorized in TTY environments for easier reading. Adjust verbosity with the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

- `DEBUG`: Detailed request/response logging and error recovery steps
- `INFO`: General operation logging
- `WARNING`: Error recovery and fallback notifications (recommended)
- `ERROR`: Only errors and failures
- `CRITICAL`: Only critical failures

## The `CLAUDE.MD` File: Guiding Gemini for Claude Code

The `CLAUDE.MD` file included in this repository is critical for achieving the best experience when using this proxy with Claude Code and Gemini.

**Purpose:**

- **Tailors Gemini to Claude Code's Needs**: Claude Code has specific ways it expects an LLM to behave, especially regarding tool use, file operations, and output formatting. `CLAUDE.MD` provides Gemini with explicit instructions on these expectations.
- **Improves Tool Reliability**: By outlining how tools should be called and results interpreted, it helps Gemini make more effective use of Claude Code's capabilities.
- **Enhances Code Generation & Understanding**: Gives Gemini context about the development environment and coding standards, leading to better code suggestions within Claude Code.
- **Reduces Misinterpretations**: Helps bridge any gaps between how Anthropic models might interpret Claude Code directives versus how Gemini might.

**How Claude Code Uses It:**

When you run `claude` in a project directory, the Claude Code CLI automatically looks for a `CLAUDE.MD` file in that directory. If found, its contents are prepended to the system prompt for every request sent to the LLM (in this case, your Gemini proxy).

**Recommendation:** Always copy the `CLAUDE.MD` from this proxy's repository into the root of any project where you intend to use Claude Code with this Gemini proxy. This ensures Gemini receives these vital instructions for every session.

## Performance Tips

- **Model Selection**: Use `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` for faster responses, `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` for more complex tasks
- **Streaming**: Keep streaming enabled for better interactivity; the proxy handles errors automatically
- **Timeouts**: Increase `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` for complex requests that need more processing time
- **Retries**: Adjust `MAX_STREAMING_RETRIES` based on your network stability
